1. Product Overview
1.1 Purpose
The Form Manager Application provides authorized administrative personnel with secure access to view and review form submissions collected through pre-existing forms. The system serves as a backend management tool for data oversight and administrative workflows.
1.2 Problem Statement
Organizations currently have operational forms collecting user submissions, but lack a secure, centralized interface for authorized personnel to authenticate and systematically review this submitted data. Manual or disparate access methods create security risks and operational inefficiencies.
1.3 Goals

Security: Implement robust authentication to protect sensitive form data
Accessibility: Provide intuitive access to form submissions for authorized users
Efficiency: Enable quick navigation and review of submitted data
Reliability: Ensure consistent, stable access to submission records

1.4 Key Stakeholders

Administrative staff who review submissions
System administrators managing user access
Data privacy/compliance officers
IT security teams
Development and QA teams
