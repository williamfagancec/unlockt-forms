Signature Widget - Functional Requirements
Core Functionality
1. Canvas Drawing

FR-1.1: The widget shall provide a drawing canvas where users can create signatures using mouse, touchpad, or stylus input
FR-1.2: The widget shall capture continuous stroke movements to create smooth signature lines
FR-1.3: The drawing area shall have a minimum recommended size of 400px width x 200px height
FR-1.4: The widget shall provide visual feedback during drawing (e.g., ink color, stroke width)

2. Clear/Redo Functionality

FR-2.1: The widget shall include a "Clear" button that removes all drawn content from the canvas
FR-2.2: Clearing the signature shall reset the canvas to its initial empty state
FR-2.3: The clear action shall require a single click/tap with no confirmation dialog

3. Form Integration

FR-3.1: The widget shall be embeddable as a standard form component
FR-3.2: The widget shall support configuration options including:

Canvas dimensions (width/height)
Stroke color
Stroke thickness
Background color
Required/optional field status


FR-3.3: The widget shall integrate with form validation (e.g., check if signature is empty before submission)

4. Submission & Storage

FR-4.1: The widget shall include a "Submit" or "Save" button
FR-4.2: Upon submission, the widget shall convert the canvas content to PNG format
FR-4.3: The PNG file shall be generated at sufficient resolution for printing/viewing (minimum 96 DPI)
FR-4.4: The widget shall store the PNG file with a unique filename (e.g., signature_[timestamp]_[userID].png)
FR-4.5: The submission shall trigger a callback or event that can be handled by the parent form

5. Validation

FR-5.1: The widget shall detect if the canvas is empty when submission is attempted
FR-5.2: If configured as required, the widget shall prevent submission when empty and display an appropriate error message
FR-5.3: The widget shall provide visual indication of validation state (valid/invalid)

6. User Experience

FR-6.1: The widget shall display a placeholder text or background (e.g., "Sign here") when empty
FR-6.2: The widget shall support both mouse and touch input methods
FR-6.3: The widget shall maintain signature quality across different screen resolutions and device pixel ratios

Technical Considerations

Use HTML5 Canvas or SVG for drawing
Consider using libraries like Signature Pad for smoother implementation
Ensure the widget is responsive and works on mobile devices
Handle file storage location (local filesystem, cloud storage, database as base64, etc.)
